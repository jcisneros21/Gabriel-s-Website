  <p class="box"> Reddit was founded by University of Virginia roommates Steve Huffman and Alexis 
  Ohanian in 2005. Condé Nast Publications acquired the site in October 2006. Reddit 
  became a direct subsidiary of Condé Nast's parent company, Advance Publications, in 
  September 2011. As of August 2012, Reddit operates as an independent entity, although 
  Advance is still its largest shareholder.</p>
